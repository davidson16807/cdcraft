A "view" is a pure function, model×parameters→dom, that reflects how components of application state (arrows, objects, etc.) are represented by dom elements. The name "view" is in reference to the "Model-View-Updater" pattern (A.K.A. "MVU" or "Elm" architecture)

Views may require callbacks as part of their parameters, which will be called to handle events from the user. These callbacks are known as "updaters".

A "node" in this application refers to anything that can serve as the source or target of an arc. 
Nodes can be either cells or arcs. If the nodes of an arc are themselves both arcs, 
then the arc is said to be a 2-arc, belonging to a 2-arrow, in a 2-category, etc.
Some representations of a node may also store the mouse or touchpad position with which the user indicated the node.

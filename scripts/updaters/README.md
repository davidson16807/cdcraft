An "updater" is a pure function, model×event→model, that reflects how application state modifies in response 
to user events (e.g. mouse clicks, button presses, key presses, modifying text, etc.)
The name "updater" is in reference to the "Model-View-Updater" pattern (A.K.A. "MVU" or "Elm" architecture)

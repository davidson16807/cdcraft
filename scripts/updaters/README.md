An "updater" is function returning a namespace of functions that reflect how events map to state operations.
All functions within the namespace represent the transformation of state in reponse to controller events. 

The name "updater" is in reference to the "Updater" 
within the "Model-View-Updater" pattern (A.K.A. "MVU" or "Elm" architecture)

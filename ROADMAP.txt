TODO:

HIGH PRIORITY:
latex export/import 
url export/import
svg export
object labels should float over bullet point when they are too big to fit where the bullet point is

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
double click on arrow/object to focus on text box
circle cursor on rmb
object label positioning
arrow label positioning
arrow curvature slider
arrow color select
arrow decorations
add zoom support to touchpad
add selection support to touchpad
fix bug where panning with touchpad resets the display
fix bug where dragging one named object on top of another causes overlap
	we likely need to store objects in a structure indexed by cell hash, so this problem could not fundamentally occur

LOW PRIORITY:
arrow/object label toggle for latex/plaintext default
non-zero-length 2-loops
arrow trim slider
arrow offset slider
arrow flip/reverse operations
json export
refresh grids on window resize
ctrl+A to select all
copy/paste
rotate/flip/mirror selections

REFACTOR:
decouple state for model/view to support soft undo/redo
refactor so app operations return new app objects
refactor Node to resemble polymorphism used by drag types

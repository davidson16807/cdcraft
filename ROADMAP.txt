TODO:

HIGH PRIORITY:
functor arrows
latex export/import 
svg export

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
arrow/object label toggle for latex/plaintext
object labels should float over bullet point when they are too big to fit where the bullet point is
circle cursor on rmb
object label positioning
arrow label positioning
arrow curvature slider
arrow color select
arrow decorations
add zoom support to touchpad
add selection support to touchpad
fix bug where dragging one named object on top of another causes overlap
	we likely need to store objects in a structure indexed by cell hash, so this problem could not fundamentally occur

LOW PRIORITY:
arrow trim slider
arrow offset slider
arrow flip/reverse operations
json export
url links
refresh grids on window resize
ctrl+A to select all
copy/paste

REFACTOR:
decouple state for model/view to support soft undo/redo
refactor so app operations return new app objects

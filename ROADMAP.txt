refactor so that toolbar buttons work through `data-*` variables
represent arrow heads and tails using svg paths and transforms
gather all diagram object arrays into a single class
remove calculation of offsetWidth/offsetHeight and use css floats in SvgArrowView
refactor so that arrow drags are degenerate selection drags,

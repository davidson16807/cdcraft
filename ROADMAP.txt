TODO:

HIGH PRIORITY:
latex export/import 
url export/import
svg export

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
double click on arrow/object to focus on text box
circle cursor on rmb
arrow curvature slider
arrow color select
add zoom support to touchpad
add selection support to touchpad
fix bug where panning with touchpad resets the display
fix bug where dragging one named object on top of another causes overlap
	we likely need to store objects in a structure indexed by cell hash, so this problem could not fundamentally occur

LOW PRIORITY:
arrow trim slider
arrow offset slider
arrow flip/reverse operations
json export
refresh grids on window resize
ctrl+A to select all
copy/paste
rotate/flip/mirror selections
automatic object label positioning: use gradient of summed sdfs of objects/arrows in 1 cell's distance
draggable arrow/object labels
barred arrows
squiggly arrows
arrow adjoint symbol
arrow pushout/pullback symbol
tooltips
internationalization
about/welcome sidebar
double arrow heads/tails

REFACTOR:
decouple state for model/view to support soft undo/redo
refactor so app operations return new app objects
refactor so that toolbar buttons work through `data-*` variables
rename: target→head, source→tail
fix naming on "curried_arcs"

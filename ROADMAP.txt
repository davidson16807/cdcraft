decouple state for model/view to support soft undo/redo

refactor so app operations return new app objects



DONE:
toggle "disabled" status on undo/redo buttons
store ids/hashes in arrow/object selections to support arrow/object settings menus and functors
refactor classes for state objects to use properties so that attributes are guaranteed readonly
scale arrows on zoom in/out
